## Original Problem Statement

**Problem Code:** VidyaVichar

**Problem Statement:** VidyaVichara is a classroom Q&A sticky board where students can post questions in real-time during lectures. Questions appear as colorful sticky notes that instructors can view, mark, and organize. The system must be built using the MERN stack, where React handles the interactive frontend, Express + Node.js manages the backend logic, and MongoDB stores all questions, statuses, and timestamps. This ensures questions are persistently saved, retrievable across sessions, and available for later review and analytics.

### Example Scenario
During a lecture on System Design principles in the Software System Development course, the instructor is explaining concepts like load balancing, caching, and database sharding. Students use VidyaVichara to post their questions in real-time without interrupting the flow of teaching. One student asks "What's the difference between horizontal and vertical scaling?", another posts "Can caching introduce consistency issues?", and a third asks "How does CAP theorem apply to microservices?".

All these questions appear as sticky notes on the instructor's board. The instructor can quickly filter to view only unanswered questions and mark questions as "answered" once addressed. At the end of class, the full set of questions (along with timestamps and statuses) is stored in the MongoDB backend, allowing the teaching assistant to review them later and prepare additional clarifications or study resources.

## Project Interpretation & Design Decisions

### Core Interpretation
We interpreted the "classroom Q&A sticky board" concept as a comprehensive learning management system that extends beyond simple question posting to include:

1. **Multi-Role Architecture**: Extended the basic student-instructor model to include Teaching Assistants for better classroom management
2. **Live Class Management**: Added the concept of "live classes" that students can join, making the Q&A contextual to specific lecture sessions
3. **Session Persistence**: Added user authentication and session management for secure access across different roles

### Key Design Decisions

#### 1. Database Schema Design
- **Flexible Schema**: Used MongoDB's flexible schema with Mongoose for rapid development while maintaining data integrity
- **Separate Collections**: Designed separate collections for users (students, teachers, TAs), classes, and doubts for better data organization
- **Relationship Mapping**: Established clear relationships between classes, users, and doubts using reference IDs

#### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- **Role-Based Access**: Implemented three distinct user roles with different permissions and interfaces
- **Simple Authentication**: Used a token-based authentication system suitable for the academic environment
- **Session Persistence**: Maintained user sessions across browser refreshes for better user experience

#### 3. Real-time Features
- **Room-based Architecture**: Implemented class-specific rooms to ensure scalability and targeted message delivery
- **Event-driven Updates**: Real-time updates for doubt posting, status changes, and class management

#### 4. User Interface Design
- **Sticky Notes Visualization**: Implemented colorful, rotated sticky notes with stable colors based on content hash
- **Role-specific Interfaces**: Designed different dashboards and views optimized for each user role

#### 5. Class Management System
- **Live vs Past Classes**: Distinguished between active (live) and completed (past) classes for better organization
- **Class Lifecycle**: Implemented complete class lifecycle from creation to ending with proper state management
- **Student Enrollment**: Added functionality for students to join classes and track their participation history
